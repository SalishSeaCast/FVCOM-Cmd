"""Functions for working with file system paths.

The :func:`fspath` function returns the string representation of a
file system path.
This provides a uniform interface for working with :class:`pathlib.Path`
objects in Python versions both before and after Python 3.6 in which the
PEP 519 file system protocol appeared.

The :func:`resolved_path` function returns an absolute :class:`pathlib.Path`
object with shell and user variables expanded and symlinks resolved.
