.. _NEMO-CmdPackageInstallation:

************************************
:kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` Package Installation
************************************

:kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` is a Python package that provides the :program:`nemo` command-line tool for doing various operations associated running with the `NEMO`_ ocean model.

.. _NEMO: http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/

These instructions assume that:

* You have an up to date clone of the `NEMO-Cmd package`_ repository.

.. _NEMO-Cmd package: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-cmd

* You have the Python 3 version of the `Anaconda Python Distribution`_ or `Miniconda`_ installed

.. _Anaconda Python Distribution: http://www.continuum.io/downloads
.. _Miniconda: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html

* :file:`$HOME/anaconda3/bin` is included in your :envvar:`PATH` environment variable if you are using the Anaconda,
  or :file:`$HOME/miniconda3/bin` is included in your :envvar:`PATH` environment variable if you are using Miniconda

To install the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package in your :kbd:`root` Anaconda or Miniconda environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd NEMO-Cmd
    $ pip install --editable .

The :kbd:`--editable` option in the :command:`pip install` commands installs the packages via symlinks so that :program:`nemo` will be automatically updated as the repo evolves.

The :kbd:`Nemo-Cmd` package can also be installed in an isolated :program:`conda` environment.
The common use case for doing so it development,
testing,
and documentation of the package;
please see the :ref:`NEMO-CmdPackageDevelopment` section for details.


.. _nemoTabCompletion:

:kbd:`<TAB>` Completion
=======================

.. note::

    :kbd:`<TAB>` completion is only available in recent versions of :command:`bash`.
    The instructions below are only useful if you are working on Ubuntu 14.04 or later.

The :program:`nemo` command line interface includes a sub-command that enables it to hook into the :program:`bash` :kbd:`<TAB>` completion machinery.
(:kbd:`<TAB>` completion or `command-line completion`_ is a shell feature whereby partially typed commands are filled out by the shell when the user presses the :kbd:`<TAB>` key.)
The :command:`nemo complete` command prints a blob of :program:`bash` code that does the job,
so,
capturing that code and executing it with the :command:`eval` command will enable completion for :program:`nemo` in your current shell session.
You can do that with the compound command:

.. code-block:: bash

    eval "$(nemo complete)"

Including that line in your :file:`~/.bashrc` file will ensure that completion for :program:`nemo` is available in every shell you launch.
