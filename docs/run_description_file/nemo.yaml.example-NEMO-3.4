# nemo command processor run description example for NEMO-3.4

# Name of the NEMO-3.4 configuration to use for the run;
# i.e. your NEMO-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG/ configuration directory
config name: SalishSea

# How is the domain to be distributed over the processors in the
# i (longitude) and j (latitude) directions?
# These values are used to set the nammpp namelist jpni & jpnj values
# and to set the number of processors and nodes in the PBS script
MPI decomposition: 6x6

# For runs on systems that use qsub/PBS/TORQUE
#
# The run_id value appears in the list of jobs display by the showq command
run_id: example
# Maximum run time requested/allowed for job
# Too low and you job will be terminated before it finishes
# Too high and you will have to wait longer on the queue for your job to start
# You have to experiment to find the "just right" value
walltime: 10:00:00
# Email address to send job begin, end, and abort notifications to
email: you@example.com
