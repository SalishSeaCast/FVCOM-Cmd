Run Description File Structure
******************************

:program:`nemo` run description files are written in YAML_.
They contain key-value pairs that define the names and locations of files and directories that the :program:`nemo` command processor uses to manage NEMO runs and their results.

.. _YAML: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation

Run description files are typically stored in a sub-directory of a version controlled directory tree in which you also store your model configuration elements such as coordinates,
bathymetry,
initial conditions fields,
namelists,
etc.
